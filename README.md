# Rank Poker Hands and Find Bad Beats

## Introduction
This library can do several things
- Rank a set of hands 5-7 cards
- Determine how many outs a hand has against another hand to win.  

I hope the unit tests are sufficient to show how to use the library.  It should be relatively straight forward to use.

## Notes
- This library has not been optimized for speed yet.  I plan on addding threads to improve performance.
- This is part of a bigger project for a no-limit holdem poker club where statistics are generated from log files.  The poker site we use is PokerNow.  The site for the statistics is https://buyinclub.github.io/. If anyone is interested in having something similiar for their poker club let me know and always interested in other ideas.
